# JungleJam

#### A creative interactive application for collaborative jamming

## Introduction
JungleJam is an interactive multi-user application for collaborative jamming developed by the group of students of Politecnico di Milano, as a project for the course Creative Programming & Computing, in 2021.
The goal of the application is to build a creative interactive and immersive experience, producing both the sound and the visual content, that are driven by the users’ behaviour and creative processes. The users can interact with the application and contribute to the content creation using their phones and OSCHook. There is no musical knowledge required from the users.
Movements of the phone (shaking, inclination..). Sensors from the phone → OSC messages. 
The users are encouraged to create together, by moving their phones and bodies. (the body movement is encouraged) 
-synchronization is encouraged
Inspiration: Warli art, African folk music, computer nature representation.
